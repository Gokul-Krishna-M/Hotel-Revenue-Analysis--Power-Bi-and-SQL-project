# Hotel-Revenue-Analysis--Power-Bi-and-SQL-project
This Power BI project focuses on revenue analysis of resort hotels, utilizing SQL as the primary tool for data transformation and modeling. The project began by converting the data source, an Excel file, into a relational database structure using MySQL Server Studio. SQL was then employed to perform various transformations and create meaningful tables for analysis.

The transformed data was seamlessly connected to Power BI, enabling advanced visualizations and further analysis. Through this integrated approach, the project aimed to extract valuable insights and gain a comprehensive understanding of the revenue patterns in resort hotels.

Upon analyzing the data, several key findings emerged. Firstly, the analysis revealed that resort hotels generate more revenue compared to other types of hotels. This insight highlights the significant contribution of the resort segment to the overall revenue of the hospitality industry. Understanding this revenue distribution allows stakeholders to make informed decisions related to resource allocation and strategic planning.

Additionally, the analysis identified Portugal as the country with the highest revenue contribution. This finding emphasizes the importance of Portugal as a prime destination for resort hotels, highlighting the potential for growth and further investment in the region. It provides a valuable opportunity for stakeholders to target marketing efforts and tailor services to enhance revenue generation in Portugal.

The Power BI visualizations generated as part of this project offer a clear and intuitive representation of the revenue data, enabling stakeholders to grasp key trends and patterns at a glance. These visualizations facilitate better decision-making, aiding in identifying areas for improvement, optimizing revenue streams, and enhancing overall performance.

In conclusion, this Power BI - SQL project successfully transformed raw data from an Excel file into a structured database using SQL and leveraged Power BI for comprehensive analysis and visualization. Through this analysis, the project revealed the significant revenue contribution of resort hotels and the prominence of Portugal as a revenue-generating country. The insights gained from this project can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions, strategizing effectively, and maximizing revenue potential in the hospitality industry.
